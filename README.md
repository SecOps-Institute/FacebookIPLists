## Daily Checked and Updated if Facebook modifies their list

Am sure most of the web admins are tired with the fake Facebook Bots who set their User-Agents manually as facebook bots impersonating Facebook and keep scraping the data

Hence I am setting up the IP Lists IPv4 and IPv6 in order to whitelist the real Facebook IP Addresses as per Facebook's Documentation. (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/additional-configuration/domains)

Please note that the list shall be checked and updated daily at 12:00PM IST (GMT + 5:30).
