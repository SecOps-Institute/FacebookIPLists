## Daily Checked and Updated if Facebook modifies their list

Am sure most of the web admins are tired with the fake Facebook Bots who set their User-Agents manually as facebook bots impersonating Facebook and keep scraping the data

Hence I am setting up the IP Lists IPv4 and IPv6 in order to whitelist the real Facebook IP Addresses as per Facebook's Documentation. (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/additional-configuration/domains)

Please note that the list shall be checked and updated daily at 12:00PM IST (GMT + 5:30) if there is a change in the IP Lists, else you shall see how old the IP Addresses have not been changed from Facebook starting from the date of 1st check in on this Repo.
